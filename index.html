            <h2>People</h2>
            <h3>Task Management</h3>
            <p>Stop work from getting lost or having tasks forgotten about. Having a standardized system for delegating out work and tracking its progress is essential. This can be as simple as using a large calendar on the wall or as complicated as implementing software such as Monday.com or Todoist. Every business is unique and the solution your team needs will also be unique.</p>

            <h3>Hiring Process</h3>
            <p>Hire great people by using efficient methods, such as assessment centers, to simulate your work during the hiring process and find who is best fit to join your team with as little investment as possible. Avoid any accusations of discrimination or favoritism by making sure your process is fair and standardized–and mostly importly–legal! Learn to uncover the hidden talent in the workforce and find the people you need.</p>

            <h3>Job Design & Pay</h3>
            <p>Make your job descriptions clear by identifying the roles and duties for your people. This allows you to get the attention of the people you want working in your business and eliminate job role confusion for the people you already have. Pay scales are just as important and should be transparent as much as possible. Learn ways to standardize pay which also helps keep wages in budget and predictable. Develop methods to reward excellence, honor seniority, encourage advancement, and ensure that employees are paid fairly for the local market.</p>

            <h3>Training & Safety</h3>
            <p>Get your team on the same page. Develop a skills matrix to identify the skills your team needs and track who needs to be trained on what and by when. Close customer service gaps and improve job safety and efficiency. Tracking your training needs is also essential for keeping insurance costs low and avoiding costly regulatory fines. Comply with MIOSHA, FMCSA, or other authorities unique to your industry by making sure your staff has the training they need.</p>

            <h3>Employee Evaluations</h3>
            <p>Don’t let your employees burn out or feel undervalued. Improve your culture by implementing a process that works to expose challenges your team faces, encourage your team’s advancement, rewards their accomplishments, corrects their deficiencies, and makes them feel heard. Having a regular and effective way of evaluating your staff is key for improving the culture and reducing turnover. </p>
